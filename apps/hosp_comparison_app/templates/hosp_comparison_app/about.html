                <div class="page_about">
                    <p>Prior to 2019, hospital chargemasters were generally 
                    closely held, and used primarily for negotiating effective payment rates (also called "allowed" charges) with insurance
                    carriers. Typically the only circumstances in which a patient would directly interact with a chargemaster is if they 
                    were both uninsured and wealthy, or if they wished to pay in cash. Otherwise, patient payments were routed through an
                    insurance carrier, which itself paid the discounted allowed charges.</p>
                    <p>Effective January 2019, CMS now requires Hospitals to post their chargemasters online, along with "standard" charges billed
                    for each MS-DRG. This change was made in order to make an incremental step towards price transparency in an effort to contain
                    rising medical costs.</p>
                    <p>This site is an effort to centralize the data available into a single platform, and further the push towards pricing transparency. </p>
                    <p>NOTE: The charges represented on this site are BILLED charges, which often do not represent the actual out-of-pocket cost for patients.
                    These prices are typically only applicable in cases where the patient is uninsured or wishes to pay in cash rather than use insurance. Even
                    in those cases, hospitals are often willing to negotiate discounted pricing in case of inability to pay. Contact your insurance provider
                    if you are seeking to determine your out-of-pocket cost.</p>
